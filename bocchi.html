     Hitori Gotoh is a high school girl who's starting to learn to play the guitar because she dreams of being in a band, but she's so shy that she hasn't made a single friend. However, her dream might come true after she meets Nijika Ijichi, a girl who plays drums and is looking for a new guitarist for her band.

	Hitori struggles with interpersonal relationships and often shies away from first encounters. She is frequently seen wearing a jersey and spends most of her time at home playing the guitar in a dark closet, hardly ever venturing out. Whenever a situation arises, she tries to hide in a trash can, cardboard box, or other objects, even performing her first live house show from inside a cardboard box. Despite her attempts to liven things up, she usually fails, either by slipping up or overdoing it. She craves approval from others, likely as a reaction to her personality. She is also, however, aware that she tends to scrutinize others and often feels pressured and anxious.
